This is an attempt to produce a relationship between a granular synthesier and some sort of attached media.

VideoGrain
ImageGrain

Basically I'm making "grains" of data that aren't audio and applying the same granular synth techniques.

For images, we can cut images into smaller representations and render them in whatever way we want on a canvas.

Some ideas:

Tile partial image reconstruction, with various filters/effects applied to each grain. Make it dynamic.

Questions:

When I break images up into smaller chunks why are there lines in my data.

I am envisioning that I am building a Granulator-esque synthesizer that will also affect media

|    | AoE |    whole sample          |

I _think_ it is possible to do that with a video where instead of taking a smaller portion of the sample, we will basically take a frame from the video.

I have it working for images sort of
